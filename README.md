## Pandas Challenge

This respository contains student and school data for an entire district, which are both found in the Resources folder. A Jupyter Notebook file was coded with Python and the Pandas Library to analyze this data in the PyCitySchools.ipynb file found in the PyCitySchools folder. The school data was grouped by schools in order to compare how they performed on test scores for a variety of grades and subjects. After the analysis was completed, a written report of the findings was laid out in the Pandas_Challenge_Analysis.docx.
